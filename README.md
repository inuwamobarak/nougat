# Nougat: Revolutionizing OCR for Scientific Documents

![nuogat](https://github.com/inuwamobarak/nougat/assets/65142149/bb997529-11c9-4e3e-baf4-f0d479936037)

## About Nougat

Nougat is an advanced Transformer-based OCR model that simplifies the process of converting complex scientific documents, often stored in PDF format, into a common and machine-readable Markdown format. Developed by a team of experts, Nougat leverages state-of-the-art architecture and training techniques to make scientific knowledge more accessible and usable.

## Key Features

- **Transformer Architecture:** Nougat uses a Swin Transformer as a vision encoder and an mBART-based text decoder, allowing for end-to-end transcription of scientific PDFs.

- **End-to-End Training:** With Nougat, there's no need for complex pipelines. The model takes raw pixels as input and generates Markdown text as output, simplifying the entire OCR process.

- **Bridging the Gap:** Nougat not only transcribes scientific documents but also bridges the gap between human-readable content and machine-readable text, making it easier to access and utilize scientific knowledge.
